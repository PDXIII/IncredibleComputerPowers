##The Plot
![Bild zu {{ page.title }}]({{ page.image }})

Bond's loyalty to M is tested when her past comes back to haunt her. Whilst MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.

##Over The Top GUI
Bond and the MI6 need to decypher an encrypted map wich presents it self as a floating polygon. When decrypted the polygon moves every node its default position with nice animations. Yes, thi looks pretty cool, but doesn't make any sense!
