##The Plot
![Bild zu {{ page.title }}]({{ page.image }})

A data courier, carrying a data package literally inside his head too large to hold for long, must deliver it before he dies from it.

##Strange IO Devices
Johnny put his goggles and his data-gloves on and enters the internet. Looks a kind of stupid and indeed is! Sure it is more visually appealing, when he does something with his hands, but wouldn`t it be more futuristic when the goggles are the output and input device with eye-tracking?

##Over The Top GUI
The internet looks like a rollercoaster in a Disney theme park. Everthing is moving and blinking. What happens when your computer doesn`t have the latest graphic chip? Does it then more look like the matrix?
