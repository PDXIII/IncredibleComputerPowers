##The Plot
![Bild zu {{ page.title }}]({{ page.image }})

A lawyer becomes a target by a corrupt politician and his NSA goons when he accidentally receives key evidence to a serious politically motivated crime.

##The Magic Computer Trick
Not enough that the secret service can see through building with the cameras of weather satellites – NO! the can rotate those images and extrude them int 3d, and then they can clipp this paper bag and look inside it! Wow!

I think this movie is one reason, why graphic designers get orders like: “Here is a icture of me. Could you please remove the hat, so people can see my hair!”
