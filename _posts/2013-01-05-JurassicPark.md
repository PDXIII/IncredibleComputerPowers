##The Plot
![Bild zu {{ page.title }}]({{ page.image }})

During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.

##Over The Top GUI
Th last survivors got shelter in the IT center of the park. They know they have to get back the controll over the computer system to stop the dinosaurs. One computer shows a 3d animated file system. The girl steps to the computer with the words: “It's a UNIX system. I know that!”
 
Actually it is a UNIX system. But what you see is an experimental file system viewer called [fsn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsn) and it didn't happen that it became the default file system viewer for UNIX systems. Guess why?
