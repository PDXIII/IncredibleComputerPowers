<p>A lawyer becomes a target by a corrupt politician and his NSA goons when he accidentally receives key evidence to a serious politically motivated crime.</p>

<h2>The Magic Computer Trick</h2>

<p>Not enough that the secret service can see through building with the cameras of weather satellites – NO! the can rotate those images and extrude them int 3d, and then they can clipp this paper bag and look inside it! Wow!</p>

<p>I think this movie is one reason, why graphic designers get orders like: “Here is a icture of me. Could you please remove the hat, so people can see my hair!”</p>
