<p>Navy CIS is a american tv show about a special investigation unit. One of the characters is a mix of a goth chick and a cyber junky who does all the forensic investigation. During this special episode the CIS computer system is attacked ba a hacker.</p>

<h2>The Awesome Keyboard Techniques</h2>

<p>This is so ridiculous. They try to fight the hacker attack, and to type faster they use one keyboard together. At the same time windows are popping up on the screen and immediately close themself. How should this work? To use the keyboard you need some kind of textfield where you write stuff into. And you can't write into two different textfields at the same time. And even though: How should you write code with just one of the half of the keys?</p>
