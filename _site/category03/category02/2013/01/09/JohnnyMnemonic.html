<h2>The Plot</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.pizzaxtremeteam.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/johnny-mnemonic.jpg" alt="Bild zu Johnny Mnemonic Is A Making Phone Call" /></p>

<p>A data courier, carrying a data package literally inside his head too large to hold for long, must deliver it before he dies from it.</p>

<h2>Strange IO Devices</h2>

<p>Johnny put his goggles and his data-gloves on and enters the internet. Looks a kind of stupid and indeed is! Sure it is more visually appealing, when he does something with his hands, but wouldn`t it be more futuristic when the goggles are the output and input device with eye-tracking?</p>

<h2>Over The Top GUI</h2>

<p>The internet looks like a rollercoaster in a Disney theme park. Everthing is moving and blinking. What happens when your computer doesn`t have the latest graphic chip? Does it then more look like the matrix?</p>
